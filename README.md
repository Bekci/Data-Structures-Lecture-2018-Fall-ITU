### Prerequisites

1. Very basic knowledge about any programming language(C++ is preferred).

### Goal
This course has several aims. One of the aims is helping the enrolled students about the data structures course, that is given by the Istanbul Technical University. The second aim of this course is preparing the students about their possible interviews.

A stable understanding of data structures is essential for every computer engineering student. Therefore, we as ITU ACM Student Branch members decided to open this kind of lectures to help Istanbul Technical University students.

The third and maybe the most important aim of this course is helping the competitive programming community. Data structures knowledge is fundamental for competitive programming questions.
